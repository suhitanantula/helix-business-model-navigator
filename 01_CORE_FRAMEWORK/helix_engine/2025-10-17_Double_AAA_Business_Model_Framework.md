# The Double-AAA Business Model Framework
## A Synthesis of Organisational Maturity and Business Model Evolution

**Created:** 2025-10-17
**Authors:** Suhit Anantula + Claude (Helix Engine Collaboration)
**Status:** Breakthrough Framework - Active Development
**Integration:** Co-Intelligent Organisation Book + MIT CISR Research

---

## Executive Summary

This framework represents a **breakthrough synthesis** of two complementary perspectives on AI transformation:

1. **The AAA Maturity Framework** (Assist → Augment → Adapt): How organisations build capability for human-AI collaboration
2. **MIT CISR Business Models Framework**: How companies create value in the AI era

**The Key Insight:** Both dimensions of business model evolution follow the AAA progression, creating a **3x3 matrix of 9 distinct business model states** that organisations can navigate strategically.

---

## The Breakthrough Insight

### Traditional MIT CISR Framework (2025)

MIT CISR identified two axes:
- **Vertical**: Action on Behalf of Customers (Assist vs. Represent)
- **Horizontal**: Business Execution (Structured vs. Adaptive)

This created 4 business models: Existing+, Customer Proxy, Modular Curator, Orchestrator.

### The Double-AAA Reframe

**Both axes are actually AAA progressions:**

**Vertical Axis: AAA on Customer Action**
- **Assist** Customers → Help them achieve outcomes (supportive role)
- **Augment** Customers → Co-create outcomes with them (partnership)
- **Adapt** For Customers → Autonomously achieve outcomes on their behalf (representation)

**Horizontal Axis: AAA on Business Execution**
- **Assist** Execution → Structured, predefined processes (Lines-dominant, humans in loop + at helm)
- **Augment** Execution → Hybrid, adaptive processes (Loops-dominant, learning systems)
- **Adapt** Execution → Autonomous, AI-orchestrated (Vibes-dominant, dynamic orchestration)

- **Modular Curator** → Q5 (Dynamic Curator)
- **Orchestrator** → Q9 (Autonomous Orchestrator)

**What We've Revealed:**
- **5 additional strategic positions** MIT didn't identify
- **Clear progression pathways** between models
- **Granular understanding** of capability requirements

### 2. Multiple Pathways to Transformation

Organisations don't have to move linearly. Different strategic pathways:

**Horizontal Progression (Execution First):**
Q1 → Q2 → Q3: Build execution capability before customer autonomy
- Best for: Risk-averse industries, regulated sectors
- Example: Banking, healthcare, legal services

**Vertical Progression (Customer First):**
Q1 → Q4 → Q7: Increase customer autonomy with structured processes
- Best for: Trust-critical relationships
- Example: Financial advisory, education

**Diagonal Progression (Balanced):**
Q1 → Q5 → Q9: Balanced advancement on both axes
- Best for: Technology companies, digital natives
- Example: Fintech, healthtech, edtech

**Strategic Skip:**
Q1 → Q5 or Q1 → Q7: Jump to high-value positions
- Risk: Capability gaps, governance failures

- Q7-Q9: High (autonomous action on behalf of others)

**Governance Risk:**
- Q1-Q3: Manageable (standard policies)
- Q4-Q6: Complex (multi-party governance)
- Q7-Q9: Critical (systemic oversight required)

**Trust Risk:**
- Q1-Q3: Building trust
- Q4-Q6: Maintaining trust through transparency
- Q7-Q9: Proving trust through outcomes

### 4. Industry-Specific Trajectories

Different industries will cluster in different regions:

**Conservative Industries (Finance, Healthcare, Legal):**
- Current state: Q1-Q2
- Near-term: Q2-Q4
- Long-term: Q5-Q7
- Unlikely to reach Q9 soon due to regulation

**Technology Companies:**
- Current state: Q2-Q3
- Near-term: Q5-Q6

- Long-term: Q3-Q6
- Focus on execution autonomy over customer autonomy

**Professional Services:**
- Current state: Q1-Q4
- Near-term: Q4-Q5
- Long-term: Q5-Q6
- Stay in co-creation zone (Augment customer)

### 5. Competitive Positioning Strategy

Use the matrix for competitive analysis:

**Map Competitors:**
- Where do competitors operate today?
- Where are they moving?
- What capabilities are they building?

**Identify White Space:**
- Which quadrants are under-served in your industry?
- Where can you create differentiated value?
- What strategic positions can you defend?

**Choose Your Battles:**
- Don't compete where everyone clusters
- Build capabilities others lack
- Create barriers to entry through maturity

## Strategic Significance

### Why This Framework Matters

**1. Fills a Critical Gap**

Existing frameworks either:
- Focus on business models (MIT CISR) without maturity pathway
- Focus on maturity (various AI maturity models) without business model implications
- Are too technical (AI readiness) or too abstract (digital transformation)

**This framework uniquely:**
- Integrates business model strategy with organisational capability
- Provides both diagnostic and planning tools
- Bridges strategic vision with execution reality

**2. Creates New Strategic Language**

Enables conversations like:
- "We're in Q2 today, targeting Q5 in 24 months"
- "Our competitors are clustered in Q1-Q4, we see white space in Q6"
- "We can't jump to Q9 - we haven't validated the Q4 triggers yet"

**3. Democratises Strategic Intelligence**

Makes sophisticated AI business model thinking:
- Accessible to any C-suite leader
- Actionable with clear pathways
- Defensible with evidence-based triggers
- Scalable across organisations

**4. Provides Competitive Advantage**

Organisations using this framework will:
- Make better strategic positioning decisions
- Avoid costly missteps (jumping quadrants prematurely)
- Identify opportunities others miss
- Build defensible market positions

### Connection to Professional Identity (Tier 2 Positioning)

**This is definitively Tier 2 work:**

**NOT Tier 1 (AI Literacy):**
- Not about learning to use ChatGPT
- Not about prompt engineering training
- Not about AI tool tutorials

**ABSOLUTELY Tier 2 (Strategic Leadership Transformation):**
- C-Suite strategic framework
- Business model innovation
- Organisational transformation
- Competitive positioning

**Positioning Statement:**
"I partner with C-Suite leaders to navigate their organisation's business model evolution in the AI era, using the Co-Intelligent Business Model Matrix to map pathways from today's position to tomorrow's strategic destination."

**3. Co-Intelligent Organisation Framework**
- 5Ps of Loop Design
- Human-AI collaboration modes
- EEE Layer (Ethics, Emotion, Emergence)
- Helix model (Strategy ↔ Design co-evolution)

### Methodological Approach

**Framework Synthesis Method:**
1. Analysed MIT CISR's two-axis framework
2. Identified both axes as AAA progressions
3. Created 3x3 matrix generating nine quadrants
4. Mapped MIT's four models to specific quadrants
5. Identified five new strategic positions
6. Integrated with six AAA maturity dimensions
7. Developed maturity triggers for all transitions
8. Validated with One NZ case study

**Validation Approach:**
- Theoretical coherence (frameworks align logically)
- Empirical grounding (MIT CISR 12-year data)
- Practical utility (addresses real strategic questions)
- Case study validation (maps to real organisations)
