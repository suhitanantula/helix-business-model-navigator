# Co-Intelligent Business Model Pattern Library

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Created:** 2025-12-04
**Framework:** Double-AAA (Co-Intelligent Business Model Matrix)

---

## Overview

This pattern library treats each of the 9 quadrants in the Co-Intelligent Business Model Matrix as a **distinct business model framework**. Companies don't just "score" a quadrant - they **embody** its operating characteristics.

### The Key Insight

> "These 9 quadrants are new business model frameworks"

Moving between quadrants requires **business model transformation**, not just capability improvement.
