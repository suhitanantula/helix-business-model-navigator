# AAA Framework Assessment Prompt

## Quadrant Positioning Logic

After gathering research data, apply this assessment framework:

---

## Step 1: Assess Customer Action Dimension

**Question: How does AI interact with customers?**

### ASSIST Customer (Q1-Q3)
- AI provides information, guidance, recommendations
- Customers make all decisions
- AI is supportive, not directive
- Examples: FAQ chatbots, product recommendations, search assistance

### AUGMENT Customer (Q4-Q6)
- AI co-creates outcomes with customers
- Shared decision-making between human and AI
- Partnership model - AI enhances human capability
- Examples: Financial planning co-pilots, personalized health coaching, adaptive learning

### ADAPT Customer (Q7-Q9)
- AI acts autonomously on behalf of customers
- Customers delegate decisions to AI within parameters
- AI represents customer interests without real-time input
- Examples: Autonomous trading, self-driving delivery, fully automated customer service

---

## Step 2: Assess Execution Dimension

**Question: How does the organization's AI operate internally?**

### ASSIST Execution (Q1, Q4, Q7)
- Structured, rule-based AI processes
- Predefined workflows and decision trees
- Humans in the loop for all significant decisions
- Limited learning or adaptation

### AUGMENT Execution (Q2, Q5, Q8)
- Adaptive, learning-based AI processes
- AI improves based on feedback and outcomes
- Hybrid human-AI decision making
- Continuous optimization within parameters

### ADAPT Execution (Q3, Q6, Q9)
- Autonomous, AI-orchestrated operations
- Minimal human intervention in operational decisions
- Self-organizing, self-optimizing systems
- Multi-agent coordination

---

## Step 3: Determine Quadrant

| Customer \ Execution | ASSIST | AUGMENT | ADAPT |
|---------------------|--------|---------|-------|
| **ADAPT** | Q7 | Q8 | Q9 |
| **AUGMENT** | Q4 | Q5 | Q6 |
| **ASSIST** | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 |

---

## Step 4: Assess Maturity Level (1-5)

### Level 1: Ad Hoc
- Scattered AI experiments
- No governance framework
- Individual team initiatives
- No strategic coordination

### Level 2: Pilot
- Structured AI pilots
- Basic governance emerging
- Executive sponsorship for key initiatives
- Early success metrics

### Level 3: Scaled
- Multiple AI systems in production
- Formal governance framework
- Cross-functional AI programs
- Measured business impact

### Level 4: Strategic
- AI embedded in business strategy
- Mature governance and ethics
- C-suite AI leadership (CAIO, CDO)
- Competitive differentiation through AI

### Level 5: AI-Native
- Business model built on AI
- AI-first culture and operations
- Industry-leading capabilities
- AI as core competitive moat

---

## Step 5: Identify Strategic Pathway

### Operational Excellence Path (Horizontal)
Q1 → Q2 → Q3
- Focus on internal efficiency first
- Build execution capability
- Conservative, low-risk progression
- Common in: Regulated industries, government

### Expertise Scaling Path (Diagonal)
Q1 → Q5 → Q6 or Q4 → Q5 → Q6
- Balance customer and execution advancement
- Build ecosystem capabilities
- Most common for large enterprises
- Common in: Banking, retail, professional services

### Autonomous Intelligence Path (Vertical then Horizontal)
Q1 → Q4 → Q7 → Q8 → Q9
- Customer autonomy first
- Then execution autonomy
- Highest risk, highest reward
- Common in: Mining, logistics, tech platforms
