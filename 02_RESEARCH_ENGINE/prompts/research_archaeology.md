# Research Archaeology Template

## Complete Transparency Documentation for AAA Company Analysis

---

## PURPOSE

This template ensures every AAA company assessment is fully documented with:
- Step-by-step research process (research archaeology)
- Complete source chain with credibility ratings
- Decision logic chains showing how quadrant was determined
- Assumption registers with confidence levels
- Alternative interpretations considered and rejected
- Limitation acknowledgment

**Accountability Standard**: Every quadrant positioning can be traced back through transparent logical steps with clear rationale.

## DECISION LOGIC CHAINS

### Customer Action Dimension Assessment

```
CUSTOMER ACTION DECISION LOGIC:

Question: At what level does AI interact with customers?

OPTION A: ASSIST Customer
├── Definition: AI provides information, customers make all decisions
├── Evidence Required: FAQ chatbots, recommendations, search help
├── Evidence Found: [List specific evidence]
├── Evidence Strength: [Strong/Moderate/Weak/None]
└── Decision: [SELECTED/REJECTED] - [Rationale]

OPTION B: AUGMENT Customer
├── Definition: AI co-creates outcomes with customers
├── Evidence Required: Financial co-pilots, personalized coaching, adaptive systems
├── Evidence Found: [List specific evidence]
├── Evidence Strength: [Strong/Moderate/Weak/None]
└── Decision: [SELECTED/REJECTED] - [Rationale]

OPTION C: ADAPT Customer
├── Definition: AI acts autonomously on behalf of customers
├── Evidence Required: Autonomous trading, self-driving delivery, full automation
├── Evidence Found: [List specific evidence]
├── Evidence Strength: [Strong/Moderate/Weak/None]
└── Decision: [SELECTED/REJECTED] - [Rationale]

FINAL DETERMINATION: [ASSIST/AUGMENT/ADAPT]
CONFIDENCE: [X]%
KEY EVIDENCE: [Primary evidence that determined this]
```

### Execution Dimension Assessment

```
EXECUTION DECISION LOGIC:

Question: How does the organization's AI operate internally?

OPTION A: ASSIST Execution
├── Definition: Structured, rule-based AI processes
├── Evidence Required: Predefined workflows, humans in all loops
├── Evidence Found: [List specific evidence]
├── Evidence Strength: [Strong/Moderate/Weak/None]
└── Decision: [SELECTED/REJECTED] - [Rationale]

OPTION B: AUGMENT Execution
├── Definition: Adaptive, learning-based AI processes
├── Evidence Required: Continuous optimization, hybrid human-AI decisions
├── Evidence Found: [List specific evidence]
├── Evidence Strength: [Strong/Moderate/Weak/None]
└── Decision: [SELECTED/REJECTED] - [Rationale]

OPTION C: ADAPT Execution
├── Definition: Autonomous, AI-orchestrated operations
├── Evidence Required: Minimal human intervention, self-organizing systems
├── Evidence Found: [List specific evidence]
├── Evidence Strength: [Strong/Moderate/Weak/None]
└── Decision: [SELECTED/REJECTED] - [Rationale]

FINAL DETERMINATION: [ASSIST/AUGMENT/ADAPT]
CONFIDENCE: [X]%
KEY EVIDENCE: [Primary evidence that determined this]
```

### Quadrant Determination

```
QUADRANT CALCULATION:

Customer Action: [ASSIST/AUGMENT/ADAPT] → Row [1-3]
Execution: [ASSIST/AUGMENT/ADAPT] → Column [1-3]

Matrix Lookup:
| Customer \ Execution | ASSIST | AUGMENT | ADAPT |
|---------------------|--------|---------|-------|
| ADAPT               | Q7     | Q8      | Q9    |
| AUGMENT             | Q4     | Q5      | Q6    |
| ASSIST              | Q1     | Q2      | Q3    |

RESULT: Q[X] - [Quadrant Name]

ALTERNATIVE QUADRANTS CONSIDERED:
├── Q[Y]: [Why this might have been possible]
│   └── REJECTED: [Specific reason with evidence]
├── Q[Z]: [Why this might have been possible]
│   └── REJECTED: [Specific reason with evidence]
