## ASSUMPTION REGISTER

| # | Assumption | Evidence Base | Confidence | Validation Method | Risk if Wrong |
|---|------------|---------------|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1 | ANZ 2030 strategy will be executed as announced | Official announcement, CEO statement | High | Quarterly updates | Overestimated trajectory |
| 2 | Suncorp integration completes successfully | 100-day report positive | Medium | Integration milestones | Distraction from AI focus |
| 3 | ANZ Plus migration accelerates | CEO mandate, platform success | Medium | Customer numbers | Slower platform transition |
| 4 | AI Immersion Centre drives culture change | Microsoft partnership, training scale | Medium | Adoption metrics | Training without adoption |
| 5 | Institutional strength cross-subsidizes retail | FY25 financial results | High | Revenue tracking | If institutional declines |

## LIMITATIONS ACKNOWLEDGMENT

### Information Gaps
- Specific AI project pipeline details not publicly disclosed
- Actual developer productivity metrics beyond headline figures
- Detailed governance framework implementation not available
- Customer satisfaction metrics for ANZ Plus limited
- Competitive benchmarking data restricted

### Methodological Limitations
- Public information only (no internal access)
- Point-in-time analysis (market evolving rapidly)
- Banking-sector patterns may not fully generalize
- Single researcher perspective

### Uncertainty Ranges
| Metric | Central Estimate | Range |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Maturity Level | 3.5/5 | ±0.5 |
| Q6 Timeline | 30 months | ±12 months |
| GAIN Score | 27/40 | ±3 |

---

## COMPARATIVE VALIDATION

### Reference Case: Westpac (Peer)

| Dimension | ANZ | Westpac |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| Quadrant | Q5 | Q5 |
| Maturity | 3.5/5 | 3.5-4.0/5 |
| Key Platform | ANZ Plus | UNITE |
| AI Users | 6,000+ | 15,000 |
| Differentiator | Institutional strength | Modern architecture |
| Q6 Timeline | 24-36 months | 24-36 months |

**Validation Conclusion:** ANZ positioning confirmed as peer to Westpac at Q5. Similar maturity but different strategic emphasis (ANZ institutional, Westpac retail platform).

### Reference Case: NAB (Peer)

| Dimension | ANZ | NAB |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Quadrant | Q5 | Q5 (High) |
| Maturity | 3.5/5 | 4.0/5 |
| Key Platform | ANZ Plus | Customer Brain |
| AI Users | 6,000+ | 15,000+ |
| Q6 Timeline | 24-36 months | 12-18 months |

**Validation Conclusion:** ANZ trails NAB in customer AI sophistication. NAB Customer Brain more advanced than ANZ Plus personalization.
