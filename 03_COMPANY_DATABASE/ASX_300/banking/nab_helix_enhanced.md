### Quadrant Determination

**RESULT: Q5 - Dynamic Curator (High End)**
- Customer: AUGMENT × Execution: AUGMENT
- Maturity: 4.0/5

**Alternative Considered:**
- Q6 (Adaptive Partner) - CONSIDERED but REJECTED because:
  - Customer Brain is adaptive but not fully autonomous
  - Operations augmented extensively but not self-optimizing
  - Timeline: 12-18 months to Q6 (fastest among Big 4)
