## LIMITATIONS ACKNOWLEDGMENT

### Information Gaps
- Customer Brain specific algorithm details not publicly disclosed
- Comparative metrics vs CBA Engagement Engine limited
- Pete Steel's specific strategic priorities not yet articulated
- Autonomous operation timeline specifics unavailable
- Internal customer satisfaction metrics not public

### Methodological Limitations
- Public information only (no internal access)
- Point-in-time analysis (market evolving rapidly)
- Banking-sector patterns may not fully generalize
- Single researcher perspective

### Uncertainty Ranges
| Metric | Central Estimate | Range |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Maturity Level | 4.0/5 | ±0.25 |
| Q6 Timeline | 15 months | ±6 months |
| GAIN Score | 31/40 | ±2 |

## COMPARATIVE VALIDATION

### Reference Case: CBA (Leader)

| Dimension | NAB | CBA |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Quadrant | Q5 (High) | Q5→Q6 |
| Maturity | 4.0/5 | 4.5/5 |
| Key Platform | Customer Brain | Engagement Engine |
| Monthly AI Interactions | 50M | ~55M decisions/day |
| AI Users | 15,000+ | 20,000+ |
| GAIN Score | 31/40 | ~33/40 |

**Validation Conclusion:** NAB confirmed as closest to CBA. Customer Brain comparable to Engagement Engine. NAB trails by 6-12 months but has fastest trajectory to Q6 among chasers.

### Reference Case: Westpac (Peer)

| Dimension | NAB | Westpac |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| Quadrant | Q5 (High) | Q5 |
| Maturity | 4.0/5 | 3.5-4.0/5 |
| Key Platform | Customer Brain | UNITE |
| Differentiator | Real-time adaptive AI | Modern architecture |
| Q6 Timeline | 12-18 months | 24-36 months |
| GAIN Score | 31/40 | 28/40 |

**Validation Conclusion:** NAB ahead of Westpac. Customer Brain more sophisticated than UNITE platform. NAB's balanced rhythm provides adaptation advantage.
