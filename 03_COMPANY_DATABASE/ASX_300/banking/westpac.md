## Current Position Summary

Westpac is undertaking one of Australia's most ambitious AI transformations, investing approximately $2B/year through the UNITE program (FY2025-2028).

## AAA Framework Assessment

### Customer Action: AUGMENT
- JESS AI co-creates with customer service operators (not autonomous)
- Digital assistants provide guidance, customers make decisions
- Mortgage AI supports bankers, customers retain decision control
- Not at ADAPT level - no autonomous customer representation

### Execution: AUGMENT
- Westpac Intelligence Layer enables adaptive, learning-based processes
- Hybrid human-AI decision making across most operations
- Not fully autonomous (ADAPT) - humans still in critical loops
- Transitioning from ASSIST (structured) to AUGMENT (adaptive)

### Result: Q5 - Dynamic Curator
Westpac is co-creating outcomes with customers (Augment) through adaptive, learning-based execution (Augment). This maps precisely to Q5 (Dynamic Curator) - the same position as CBA, though with lower maturity level.

## Capability-Ambition Gap Analysis

| Dimension | Stated Ambition | Current Capability | Gap |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-----|
| Data Infrastructure | Enterprise-wide AI | 251 systems integrating | Medium (in progress) |
| Customer AI | Personalized banking | Q5 co-creation | Small |
| Autonomous Operations | "Digital twin" vision | Q5 hybrid | Medium |
| Governance | Leading practice | 8 principles, C-suite owner | Small |
| Competitive Position | Match CBA | 6+ years behind | Large |

**Overall Gap Assessment:** MEDIUM
- Significant investment is closing gaps
- Governance framework is mature
- Technology infrastructure catching up
- CBA's 6-year lead requires sustained execution

---

## Comparable Benchmark

**Reference Case:** Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)

CBA achieved #1 APAC AI leadership through:
1. **Governance-first investment** - 18 months before APRA mandate
2. **Customer Engagement Engine** - 55M decisions/day, 157B data points
3. **10+ years** of sustained AI investment
4. **C-suite AI leadership** - established early

**Key Learning:** Westpac's appointment of CBA's former Chief Data Officer signals intent to replicate the governance-first pattern. The 3-year aggressive investment trajectory ($2B/year) can close 50% of the capability gap if executed well.

## Strategic Opportunity

### Value Proposition
"Westpac is at Q5 (Dynamic Curator) with Q6 ambitions, investing $2B/year to close the gap with CBA's market-leading AI position. Your appointment of CBA's former Chief Data Officer signals intent to replicate their governance-first pattern. The strategic question isn't whether to invest in AI, but how to sequence capability building for fastest Q5→Q6 advancement while CBA extends to Q6→Q7."

### Recommended Focus Areas
1. **Governance-as-Moat Optimization** - Leverage the 8 Responsible AI Principles as competitive differentiator, not just compliance
2. **Intelligence Layer Acceleration** - Fast-track the 251 system consolidation to enable Q6 adaptive capabilities
3. **Capability Sequencing** - Prioritize the dimensions where gap is largest (competitive position, autonomous operations)

| Factor | Score | Rationale |

| Investment Scale | 5/5 | $2B/year supports $300K+ engagement easily |
| Decision Urgency | 5/5 | New CEO, CBA competitive pressure, new CDAO |
| Governance Readiness | 4/5 | 8 principles established, C-suite ownership |
| Strategic Gap | 5/5 | Behind CBA, aware of it, acting on it |
| C-Suite Access | 5/5 | New CDAO from CBA, CTO publicly visible |
| **Total** | **24/25** | |

**Engagement Viability:** VERY HIGH
