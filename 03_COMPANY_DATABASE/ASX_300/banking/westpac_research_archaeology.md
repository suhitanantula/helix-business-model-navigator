### Step 5: Quadrant Assessment Logic

```
CUSTOMER ACTION DECISION CHAIN:

OPTION A: ASSIST Customer
├── Definition: AI provides information, customers make all decisions
├── Evidence Found:
│   ├── FAQ chatbots: Yes (basic chatbot exists)
│   ├── Product recommendations: Yes (digital channels)
│   └── Search assistance: Yes (mobile app)
├── Evidence Strength: Moderate
└── Assessment: Present but not defining characteristic

OPTION B: AUGMENT Customer ← SELECTED
├── Definition: AI co-creates outcomes with customers
├── Evidence Found:
│   ├── JESS AI: Co-creates scam detection with operators + customers
│   ├── Mortgage AI: Co-creates assessments with specialists + customers
│   ├── Digital assistants: Guide decisions, customers decide
│   ├── Personalization: Adaptive recommendations
│   └── SafeCall: Customer-AI collaboration on fraud
├── Evidence Strength: STRONG
├── Key Indicator: JESS AI explicitly described as "assistant" that works alongside
└── Assessment: Clear AUGMENT positioning - shared decision-making model

OPTION C: ADAPT Customer
├── Definition: AI acts autonomously on behalf of customers
├── Evidence Found:
│   ├── Autonomous trading: None
│   ├── Delegated decisions: None
│   ├── Customer representation: None
│   └── Self-executing actions: None
├── Evidence Strength: None
└── Assessment: No evidence of customer autonomy level

CUSTOMER ACTION DETERMINATION:
├── SELECTED: AUGMENT
├── REJECTED: ASSIST (too limited), ADAPT (no evidence)
├── Key Evidence: JESS AI co-creation model, Mortgage AI partnership
├── CONFIDENCE: 90%
└── Uncertainty: Could be ASSIST if JESS/Mortgage AI are less integrated than stated

---

EXECUTION DECISION CHAIN:

OPTION A: ASSIST Execution
├── Definition: Structured, rule-based AI processes
├── Evidence Found:

├── Evidence Found:
│   ├── Westpac Intelligence Layer: Enables adaptive, learning processes
│   ├── 5x faster ML deployment: Indicates learning systems
│   ├── Hybrid decision-making: Mortgage AI supports, humans decide
│   ├── Continuous optimization: AI Shark Tank indicates iteration
│   └── "5-40% productivity improvements": Learning-based gains
├── Evidence Strength: STRONG
├── Key Indicator: Intelligence Layer explicitly designed for adaptive AI

OPTION C: ADAPT Execution
├── Definition: Autonomous, AI-orchestrated operations
├── Evidence Found:
│   ├── Minimal human intervention: Not yet
│   ├── Self-organizing systems: Not evident
│   ├── Multi-agent coordination: Not evident
│   └── Autonomous operations: No evidence
├── Evidence Strength: None
└── Assessment: Not at ADAPT level

EXECUTION DETERMINATION:
├── SELECTED: AUGMENT
├── REJECTED: ASSIST (too limited), ADAPT (not there yet)
├── Key Evidence: Westpac Intelligence Layer, hybrid decision model
├── CONFIDENCE: 85%
└── Uncertainty: Could be ASSIST if Intelligence Layer less advanced than stated

---

QUADRANT CALCULATION:

Customer Action: AUGMENT → Row 2
Execution: AUGMENT → Column 2

Matrix Lookup:
| Customer \ Execution | ASSIST | AUGMENT | ADAPT |
|---------------------|--------|---------|-------|
| ADAPT               | Q7     | Q8      | Q9    |
| AUGMENT             | Q4     | Q5      | Q6    |  ← Here
| ASSIST              | Q1     | Q2      | Q3    |

RESULT: Q5 - Dynamic Curator

ALTERNATIVE QUADRANTS CONSIDERED:

├── Q4 (Co-Creation Assistant):
│   ├── Would Apply If: Execution was ASSIST (rule-based)
│   ├── Evidence Against: Westpac Intelligence Layer shows learning capability
│   └── REJECTED: Execution evidence supports AUGMENT not ASSIST

├── Q6 (Adaptive Partner):
│   ├── Would Apply If: Execution was ADAPT (autonomous)
│   ├── Evidence Against: Humans still in critical loops, not self-organizing
│   └── REJECTED: Clear hybrid model, not autonomous operations

├── Q2 (Smart Assistant):
│   ├── Would Apply If: Customer was ASSIST (information only)
│   ├── Evidence Against: JESS AI shows co-creation, not just information
│   └── REJECTED: Co-creation evidence too strong

QUADRANT CONFIDENCE: 88%
```

## ASSUMPTION REGISTER

| # | Assumption | Source | Confidence | If Wrong |
|---|------------|--------|------------|----------|
| 1 | UNITE investment is primarily AI-focused | Analyst reports infer this | Medium | Maturity could be lower if mostly legacy modernization |
| 2 | Intelligence Layer is learning-based | CEO description | High | Execution could be ASSIST if rule-based |
| 3 | JESS AI involves true co-creation | Company description | Medium-High | Customer Action could be ASSIST if just assistance |
| 4 | CBA gap is ~6 years | Industry estimates | Medium | Competitive position could be better/worse |
| 5 | Governance framework is operational | Company statements | High | Maturity could be lower if aspirational |

## COMPARATIVE VALIDATION

### Reference Case: Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)

```
COMPARISON ANALYSIS:

SIMILARITIES (Supporting Q5 Positioning):
├── Both pursuing Expertise Scaling path (Q1 → Q5 → Q6)
├── Both have formal governance frameworks
├── Both have C-suite AI leadership
├── Both use hybrid human-AI decision models
├── Both have scaled AI deployments (not just pilots)
└── CONCLUSION: Same quadrant appropriate

DIFFERENCES (Explaining Maturity Gap):
├── CBA: 10+ years AI investment vs Westpac: Recent acceleration
├── CBA: Customer Engagement Engine (55M decisions/day) vs Westpac: Building Intelligence Layer
├── CBA: #1 APAC AI position vs Westpac: Catching up
├── CBA: Governance established 18 months early vs Westpac: Hiring CBA's Chief Data Officer
└── CONCLUSION: Same quadrant, lower maturity justified

VALIDATION RESULT: Comparison supports Q5 at 3.5-4.0 maturity
```

└── Trigger for Reassessment: Evidence of rule-based execution only

Maturity:
├── Most Likely: 3.75/5
├── Range: 3.5 to 4.0
├── Key Uncertainty: Intelligence Layer progress
└── Trigger for Reassessment: FY26 results

Engagement Viability:
├── Score: 24/25
