## Decision Logic Chains

### Q5 Positioning Decision

**Question:** Why Q5 (Dynamic Curator) and not Q6 (Adaptive Partner)?

**Evidence Chain:**
1. **AI augments drug development** → Human scientists still lead discovery (Source 8)
2. **ML outperforms clinicians** → But clinical decisions remain human (Source 8)
3. **10x wave planning acceleration** → Infrastructure AI is advanced (Source 7)
4. **Deviation AI in trials** → Monitoring augments, doesn't replace (Source 7)

**Decision Logic:**
- Q5: AI curates and presents options, humans decide ✓
- Q6: AI adapts autonomously to patient/customer needs
- CSL's clinical AI informs decisions but doesn't make them autonomously
- Regulatory environment (FDA/TGA) requires human oversight

**Conclusion:** Q5 (Dynamic Curator) - AI enhances human decision-making
**Confidence:** 90%

**Alternatives Considered:**
| Alternative | Rejection Rationale |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Q4 (Co-Creation Assistant) | AI too advanced for mere assistance |
| Q6 (Adaptive Partner) | Clinical AI not yet autonomous |
| Q8 (Intelligent Proxy) | Pharma doesn't have "proxy" operations like mining |

---

### Maturity Level Decision

**Question:** Why 3.5/5 maturity?

**Evidence Chain:**
1. **Cloud migration in progress** → Not yet complete (Source 7)
2. **R&D restructuring announced** → Organizational change underway (Source 1)
3. **59 clinical trials** → Scaled deployment ✓ (Source 3)
4. **AI in multiple domains** → Beyond pilots (Sources 7, 8, 9)

**Decision Logic:**
- Level 3: Scaled deployment ✓ (59 trials, multiple AI applications)
- Level 4: Strategic integration - Partially (restructuring underway)
- In transition from 3 → 4

**Conclusion:** 3.5/5 - Scaled deployment with strategic integration emerging
**Confidence:** 85%

### GAIN Score Component Analysis

| Component | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Growth | 7/10 | Q5→Q6 pathway, $1.359B R&D, 59 trials (Sources 1, 3) |
| Amplification | 7/10 | 10x wave planning, 30% cost savings (Source 7) |
| Intelligence | 8/10 | AI across drug pipeline, Deviation AI, agentic AI (Sources 7, 8) |
| Novelty | 7/10 | Centenary Fellowships, Every Cure, EU AI Act prep (Sources 11, 15) |
| **Total** | **29/40** | |

## Assumption Register

| # | Assumption | Confidence | Impact if Wrong |
|---|------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Cloud migration completes by Dec 2025 | 85% | Could delay AI capability |
| 2 | $500M+ annual savings achievable | 80% | May overstate efficiency gains |
| 3 | ML models validated for clinical use | 90% | Regulatory risk if not |
| 4 | Deviation AI production-ready | 85% | Trial optimization may be limited |
| 5 | R&D restructuring improves productivity | 75% | Disruption may slow innovation |

## Limitation Acknowledgment

### Information Gaps

| Gap | Severity | Mitigation |
|-----|----------|------------|
| Specific AI budget not disclosed | Medium | Inferred from R&D and cloud spending |
| Clinical AI outcomes not quantified | Medium | Qualitative evidence used |
| Competitive positioning incomplete | Low | CB Insights/IMD rankings referenced |
| EU AI Act readiness details limited | Low | Governance statement referenced |

### Uncertainty Ranges

| Metric | Reported | Range | Basis |
|--------|----------|-------|-------|
| Wave planning acceleration | 10x | 8-12x | Implementation variability |
| Cost savings | 30% | 25-35% | Scope definition |
| GAIN Score | 29/40 | 27-31 | Assessment variability |
| Q6 Timeline | 24-36 months | 18-48 months | Regulatory/execution uncertainty |

## Cross-Reference Validation

### 10x Acceleration Claim Validation

| Source | Claim | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| AWS Case Study (7) | 10x acceleration in wave planning | Primary source |
| AWS Case Study (7) | 12x improvement in application discovery | Corroborates |
| AWS Case Study (7) | 20x overall discovery improvement | Corroborates |

**Verdict:** High confidence - AWS case studies are rigorous

### Leadership Validation
