## Key Insights

### Pattern 1: The Q5 Cluster
45% of mature Australian enterprises cluster at Q5 (Dynamic Curator). This is the "sweet spot" where organizations can co-create with customers through adaptive systems without requiring full autonomy.

### Pattern 2: Governance as Moat
CBA's #1 APAC position came from investing in governance 18 months before APRA mandate. This pattern is replicable - governance creates competitive advantage, not just compliance.

### Pattern 3: Sector-Specific Paths
- **Banking:** Expertise Scaling (Q1→Q5→Q6), governance-first
- **Mining:** Autonomous Intelligence (Q1→Q8→Q9), operations-first
- **Retail:** Expertise Scaling (Q1→Q5→Q6), data-first
- **Telco:** Dual path (customer Q5, operations Q8)
