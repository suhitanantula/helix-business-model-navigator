## Decision Logic Chains

### Q8 Positioning Decision

**Question:** Why Q8 (Intelligent Proxy) and not Q9 (Autonomous Orchestrator)?

**Evidence Chain:**
1. **300 autonomous trucks** → Largest fleet globally (Source 14)
2. **Spence 100% autonomy** → Complete autonomous operation achieved (Source 6)
3. **$1B from data automation** → Proven value from AI (Source 12)
4. **Digital twins + GenAI** → Predictive decision-making (Source 4)

**Decision Logic:**
- Q9 requires full autonomous orchestration without human oversight
- BHP still operates IROCs with human oversight
- Strategic decisions require human approval
- FY2027 target: 85% WAIO autonomy (not 100%)

**Conclusion:** Q8 (Intelligent Proxy) - Near-autonomous but human oversight maintained
**Confidence:** 95%

**Alternatives Considered:**
| Alternative | Rejection Rationale |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Q7 (Traditional Proxy) | 300 autonomous trucks far exceed Q7 threshold |
| Q9 (Autonomous Orchestrator) | Human oversight still required for strategic decisions |
| Q6 (Adaptive Partner) | Mining operations don't have "customer" in traditional sense |

---

### Maturity Level Decision

**Question:** Why 4.5/5 maturity?

**Evidence Chain:**
1. **$9.8B capital investment FY25** → Major technology commitment (Source 3)
2. **Singapore AI Hub established** → Institutional capability building (Source 1)
3. **BHP Operating System** → Standardized AI-enabled processes (Source 13)
4. **Predictive maintenance globally** → Scaled deployment (Source 5)

**Decision Logic:**
- Level 4: Strategic integration ✓
- Level 5: AI-native business model - Not yet (mining still core competency)
- In transition from 4 → 5

**Conclusion:** 4.5/5 - Strategic integration with AI-native elements emerging
**Confidence:** 90%

### GAIN Score Component Analysis

| Component | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Growth | 9/10 | Q8→Q9 pathway, $9.8B investment, AI Hub (Sources 1, 3) |
| Amplification | 8/10 | $1B value, 80-90% safety improvement (Sources 5, 12) |
| Intelligence | 9/10 | 300 trucks, digital twins, IROCs (Sources 4, 5, 14) |
| Novelty | 8/10 | BHP Ventures, muon tomography, XCMG (Sources 11, 18) |
| **Total** | **34/40** | |

## Assumption Register

| # | Assumption | Confidence | Impact if Wrong |
|---|------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Autonomous truck count (300) is accurate | 95% | Could affect competitive ranking |
| 2 | $1B value from data automation sustained | 85% | May overstate ROI potential |
| 3 | Singapore AI Hub operational in FY26 | 90% | Could delay capability building |
| 4 | XCMG partnership delivers ($1.2B/5yr) | 80% | Equipment development may be slower |
| 5 | 85% WAIO autonomy by FY27 achievable | 85% | Q9 timeline may extend |
