## Full Research Response

### Google Cloud Partnership Extension (2025)
On Monday, 14 April 2025, Google Cloud and Woolworths Group marked a new five-year strategic agreement aimed at further enabling the power of data and insights for the Group. Building on the robust foundation with Google Cloud, this renewed partnership will empower Woolworths to further strengthen data, insights, and automation capabilities.

Google Cloud was announced as Partner of the Year at the annual Woolworths Group Technology and Business Enablement Awards. Woolworths Group CIO and Managing Director Group Enablement, John Hunt, stated the company is "fortunate to enjoy rich partnerships in the Technology arena."

### Data Platform and Analytics
TCS partnered with Woolworths to establish the foundations of a common data platform and onboard key company data from its sales, finance, and supply chain business units. The platform enabled a company-wide data lake as a single source of truth with self-service analytics, empowering employees across business units to create new value.

All data is now contained in a modern, scalable environment to inform stakeholders on everything from pricing and shelf usage to delivery management and staffing requirements. As a result, granular insights into challenges and opportunities are available in a much quicker and more cost-effective environment.

### Platform Modernization
Over the last five years, the group has focused on modernizing platforms by replacing old equipment every year as part of its capital spend.

Five years ago, "Stop Trade Events" (where stores can't service customers) totaled 600 hours a year. This year, it's 40 hours a year - a 93% reduction directly correlated with replacing old systems.

### Supply Chain & Replenishment Modernization
RELEX Solutions is set to collaborate with Woolworths to deploy its Replenishment system across the retailer's distribution centres and 1,400 outlets throughout Australia and New Zealand. Woolworths Group director of group replenishment Justin Henderson stated they "identified an opportunity to modernise our existing replenishment platform to support maximising product availability for customers."

### API Strategy & Woolworths New Zealand
Over the last two to three years, Woolworths New Zealand has developed an API strategy that enables organizational agility and modernization, supporting the ability to react quickly to changing market conditions. This enables experiences across channels such as the online store, mobile app, and Everyday Rewards loyalty program.

Nearly 180 million requests now flow through Apigee X per month, delivering improvements in revenue and other business-critical metrics.

### Investment Scale
Woolworths is sharing in $2 billion of investment, with their supply chain upgrade continuing over FY24 and an ecommerce fulfilment centre expected to open in late 2024.
